			<u>WHY?</u>
		</p>
		<dl class="font2">
			<dt class="color8">
				Why is this heppening?
			</dt>
			<dd class="color7">
				Industrial society loves using fossil fuels as a workhorse to do our hard labor.
				<br>
				While building up massive projects, we have also released massive ammounts of CO<sub>2</sub> into our atmosphere.
				<br>
				America and China alone have released 1.65(10<sup>7</sup>)metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2021. Believe it or not, this is down roughly 12% since a decade ago.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dt class="color8">
				Human avarice for abundant and cheap energy has driven us to emit CO<sub>2</sub> in prodigious quantities.
			</dt>
			<dd class="color7">
				When life began on Earth, O<sub>2</sub> was considered a poison. Unfortunately, we need oxygen, or we would be saving the planet with pollution. (But then we would still have an oxygen problem.)
			<dt class="color8">
				The real question is "How do we utilize energy without suffocating, roasting, or poisoning ourselves?"
			</dt>
			<dd class="color7">
				The pragmatic solution is to invest in renewable energies like wind, solar, fusion, wave, and tidal energies. More solutions tend away from single-use disposable items and toward reusable things from local, recycleable materials.
				<br>
				-OR
				<br>
				We could in biodomes on Earth, where we can filter out everything from pollution, to heat, and even radiation. But we have to be able to grow our food in them too, or that'll be poisoned, roasted, and probably won't grow very well.

			<u>WHEN?</u>

				About a century ago.

			<br>
			<dt class="color8">
				When is it too late?
			</dt>
			<dd class="color7">
				Conservative estimates suggest it "may not be too late." By modest guesses, not worried about causing panic and hurting feelings, it may already be too late to be considered reversible. <mark><u>This does not mean "just give up, it's too late anyway!"</u></mark>
				<br>
				This ultimately means that although we are leaving a scar on Mother Earth, we should <i>really try</i> to ease up on the depth at which we are cutting into our most precious resource.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dt class="color8">
				When can we stop worrying then?
			</dt>
			<dd class="color7">
				We can't. Planetary momentum takes a lot of effort and a long time to be moving in a noticable direction, and equally as much time and effort to decelerate and stop. This means ending the warming trend, NOT begining a cooling trend. To fix our issue completely, we may need the better part of a millennia.
				<br>
				Even when climate issues are no longer a "thing," society will still need to remain conscientious of our impact on our environment.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dt class="color8">
				When will we "crash and burn" if we stay our course?
			</dt>
			<dd class="color7">
				It won’t <i>actually</i> be a “blow” or literal “crash and burn,” it is more like the process of getting a sunburn: the line between a nice tan and starting to burn is very blurry, but getting a severe sunburn is unmistakable. The process will seem like a relatively slow process of gradual change lasting years. Relative to the Earth, even a century is an ephemeral period, though. (A century may be a lifetime+ for individuals, perhaps a generation or two for a family, but relatively seconds as far as evolution sees it, and less than a Plank-time [10<sup>-44</sup>s] for Earth.) Delaying a complete holocaust is better than throwing the world into an inferno immediately.
